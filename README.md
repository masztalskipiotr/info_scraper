## About

`scraper.py` is a web scraping script used to extract some of my university's deans office staff members information, but you can use this concept to capture virtually any data from the web.

`dziekanat.csv` is the outcome file you get after running `scraper.py`

## Requirements

This script uses python modules: BeautifulSoup and Urllib so make sure to install them before you try to run this code.
